# AWS-Labs-Projects

## Introduction

After recently receiving the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification, I immediately began studying for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect certification. I'm aware that certifications don't mean much, and experience does, so I want to be able to keep track of any labs or projects I've completed as a way to keep track of my progress.
